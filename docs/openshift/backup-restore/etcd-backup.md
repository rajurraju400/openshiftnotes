# Control plane backup 

## Backing up etcd 

etcd is the key-value store for OpenShift Container Platform, which persists the state of all resource objects.

Back up your clusterâ€™s etcd data regularly and store in a secure location ideally outside the OpenShift Container Platform environment. Do not take an etcd backup before the first certificate rotation completes, which occurs 24 hours after installation, otherwise the backup will contain expired certificates. It is also recommended to take etcd backups during non-peak usage hours because the etcd snapshot has a high I/O cost.

Be sure to take an etcd backup after you upgrade your cluster. This is important because when you restore your cluster, you must use an etcd backup that was taken from the same z-stream release. For example, an OpenShift Container Platform 4.y.z cluster must use an etcd backup that was taken from 4.y.z.


### Backing up etcd data

#### Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have checked whether the cluster-wide proxy is enabled.

#### Procedure

1. Start a debug session for a control plane node:

```
oc debug node/<node_name>
```

2. Change your root directory to /host:

```
chroot /host
```

3. If the cluster-wide proxy is enabled, be sure that you have exported the NO_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY, and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables. (optional)


4. Run the cluster-backup.sh script and pass in the location to save the backup to.


```
sh-4.4# /usr/local/bin/cluster-backup.sh /home/core/assets/backup
```
